# Objective of the code
# Of current S&P 500 stocks, we analyze which one performed best in April 2020, and some of their data, including min, max, mean price, standard deviation of closing prices, and percentage change in price. 
# We chose April 2020 as our target time period, because it is an interesting one to analyze since it was right at the beginning of the pandemic. 
# Some of the current stocks were not in the list back in April 2020, which is the reason for the errors regarding these companies when running the code.
